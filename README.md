## 🛠️ Advanced Usage Tips
- **Regular Checkups**: Perform a full hardware “health check” every few months  
- **New Device Inspection**: Test screens, keyboards, and peripherals right after purchase  
- **Before Meetings**: Quickly verify microphone and camera before important calls  
- **Gaming Gear Tuning**: Use the mouse test to optimize polling rate and responsiveness  

---

## 🔍 Testing Principles (Brief)
- **Mouse Tests**: Use high-precision JavaScript timing APIs to record click intervals and analyze switch behavior  
- **Keyboard Tests**: Listen to global keyboard events and visualize key press/release states  
- **Audio Tests**: Use the Web Audio API to analyze microphone input waveforms and frequency data  
- **Screen Tests**: Use full-screen CSS color blocks and Canvas rendering to expose pixel defects  

If hardware issues are detected, we recommend contacting the manufacturer for repair or replacement.  
Regular testing helps catch problems early and prevents disruptions to work or entertainment.

> **Pro Tip:** Most hardware failures show early warning signs — detecting them early can save hours of troubleshooting later.
